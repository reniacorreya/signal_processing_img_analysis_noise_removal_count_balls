# signal_processing_img_analysis_noise_removal_count_balls
A Matlab program to remove noise from audio files and to count number of coloured balls in various images.

1. Audio Signal Processing:
There are three audio files with the same base signal of interest, each of which contains different background noise (audio_in_noise1.wav, audio_in_noise2.wav, audio_in_noise3.wav). Noise is removed with the help of a frequency plot.

2. Image Analysis:
Photos of coloured balls on a cream coloured carpet with various difficulties are placed in the media_files folder. The code automatically count the number of balls in the images. Additionally, it counts the number of balls of each colour in optical images found in the photos.
